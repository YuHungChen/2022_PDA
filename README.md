## Lab1
* This is an exercise lab to review corner stitching data structure.
* Organize the space tiles as maximal horizontal stripes.
* No space tile has other space tiles immediately to its right or left and every space tile
must be as wide as possible

* The input example

## Lab2
* This programming assignment asks us to write a fixed-outline floorplanner that can handle hard macros
* The primary objective is to place all blocks into the fixed outline successfully and to minimize the cost
* Input file (block)

## Lab3
* You would get a chip design and cell information with a global placement result.
* You need to align all standard cells to feasible rows and legalize all standard cells without overlap
* Using abacus
* Initial block locations:
